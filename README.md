### Palestine Solidarity Map – Berlin

This map highlights venues, spaces, and events in Berlin that are supportive of Palestinian people — whether through solidarity, cultural programming, volunteering, education, or community organizing. The goal is to make these spaces more visible and accessible to those who want to connect, learn, and support.

This is a personal initiative. The views expressed here are my own and do not represent any group or organization. Supporting Palestinian rights and well-being is not the same as being anti-Israel — this map is about standing with people who are suffering, not against anyone else.

If you know of a space that should be included, you’re warmly encouraged to contribute. If you represent a venue listed here and wish to be removed, please don’t hesitate to reach out — your request will be respected.

This project is grounded in care, not harm. If it becomes clear that the map poses a risk to any individuals or places, it will be restricted or taken down to protect those involved.
